## Course description
As contemporary biologists we have entered an age where the use of computers in our daily work has become all but essential. The manipulation and analysis of DNA, RNA and protein data by electronic means has become a routine task. Further, the amount of DNA, RNA and protein sequence data we are putting into databases every day is expanding at a geometric rate, and with coming advances in sequencing technology this rate is only expected to increase. With all this new data, analysis by individual humans is simply not possible. Thus, in the past 15 years, computational biology has emerged as a field concerned with storage, manipulation, and extraction of valuable information from all this new data. However, because computational biology is an emerging field, organized courses are generally saved for higher-level study, and often are not required parts of an undergraduate curriculum. We seek to fill this void in education and create a course that will introduce students to bioinformatics at an earlier point in their education. This knowledge will prove to be not simply useful, but essential, for any student considering a degree in any area of biology and medical science.

> ## Unique class procedures /structures:
> This course will be taught with the extensive use of terminal, investigation and problem solving. Students will be using computers in most sessions to analyze data, write/run code, troubleshoot and discuss.
{: .challenge}

> ## Student Learning Outcomes:
> SLO 1:  Through terminal, students will demonstrate the ability to design experimental strategies using state-of-the-art methods/approaches to address biological questions.
> SLO 2: Through computational work and in class discussions, students will demonstrate a working understanding of advanced topics in bioinformatics.
> SLO 3:  Through written and oral summaries, students will demonstrate the ability to critically evaluate the salient points of primary research articles.
? SLO 4:  Students will demonstrate the ability to summarize and effectively lead discussions of primary research literature.

## Grading Criteria, Scale, and Standards:
You will be graded on your participation in class, the leadership of class discussions, and quality of your written assignment and midterm and final exams.  Final grades may be adjusted on a sliding scale to ranges lower than those indicated below if appropriate.  Students consistently receiving 70% or lower on exams should realize they are in serious difficulty and should seek help from the instructor.

### Class Participation: 
You are required to attend all scheduled classes (both Tuesdays and Thursdays) regardless of material scheduled.  It is your responsibility to notify the instructor if circumstances beyond your control prevent your attendance in any class.  Reasonable excuses include family or medical emergencies, legal summons, religious holidays, travel to academic/scientific conferences, etc.  Unacceptable excuses include sleeping in, birthdays or anniversaries, leisure activities including travel, conflicts with work, etc.  For university policy regarding class absence, see [UAM 3,020](https://www.unr.edu/administrative-manual/3000-3999-students/3020-class-absence-policy). Your participation is required for the success of the course and will be graded.

### Term Paper:
You will prepare a 4 – 5 pp. written “mini-review” of bioinformatics from a list provided by the instructor.  Your review will summarize the state-of-the-art in a particular topic area while citing both seminal historical and modern, cutting edge references that have defined major advances in the field. This review should demonstrate your ability to understand and critically review primary literature dealing with advanced topics in bioinformatics.

### Exams: 
There will be one midterm and one final exam. Both will be written and will use the computer. Each will test your knowledge of material for one half of the course (i.e. the midterm will test the first half of the semester, and the final will test the second half). In addition, the final exam will include a written analysis of bioinformatics.

### Course Component Points
