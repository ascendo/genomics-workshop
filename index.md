The philosophy of 'BCH709 Introduction to Bioinformatics' is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that student can get their own bioinformatics work done without pain. This teaches concept of bioinformatics analysis and Next Generation Sequencing for genomics including: hands-on bioinformatics, understanding genomics through bioinformatics, use of command-line in multiple platform, use of command-line tools to analyze sequencing data, and connecting to and using cloud computing.

> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes that learners have no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including the 
> concept of genomic variation within a population. Participants should bring their own laptops and plan to participate actively. 
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to 
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

# Workshop Overview 

| Lesson    | Overview |
| ------- | ---------- |
| [Project organization and management](https://datacarpentry.github.io/organization-genomics/) | Learn how to structure your metadata, organize and document your genomics data and bioinformatics workflow, and access data on the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) database.|
| [Introduction to the command line](https://datacarpentry.github.io/shell-genomics/) |  Learn to navigate your file system, create, copy, move, and remove files and directories, and automate repetitive tasks using scripts and wildcards. |
|[Data wrangling and processing](https://datacarpentry.github.io/wrangling-genomics/) | Use command-line tools to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualize between-sample variation. |
|[Introduction to cloud computing for genomics](http://www.datacarpentry.org/cloud-genomics/) | Learn how to work with Amazon AWS cloud computing and how to transfer data between your local computer and cloud resources. 

# Optional Additional Lessons

| Lesson | Overview |
| ------- | -------- |
| [Intro to R and RStudio for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/) | Use R to analyze and visualize between-sample variation. |

# Teaching Platform
This workshop is designed to be run on pre-imaged Amazon Web Services (AWS)
instances. All the software and data used in the workshop are hosted on an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
If you want to run your own instance of the server used for this workshop, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab.
